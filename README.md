# dbt Projects

## Local dbt Setup Using 3 Musketeers

Local dbt setup using the 3 Musketeers pattern and a `Makefile` to automate the setup steps required when initially creating a DBT project.

## Examples

Example usage of dbt, e.g.:

* Simple example of how to setup a 'multiple dbt project structure' (i.e., non-monolithic)
* CICD (potentially old) - simple examples of using dbt within CI pipelines
* Demos - showcasing how dbt works to those without any prior knowledge
